 * <p>
 * In biochemistry and pharmacology, a ligand (from the Latin ligandum, binding) is a substance
 * (usually a small molecule), that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose.
 * In a narrower sense, it is a signal triggering molecule, binding to a site on a target protein.
 * The binding occurs by intermolecular forces, such as ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
 * forces. The docking (association) is usually reversible (dissociation). Actual irreversible covalent
 * bonding between a ligand and its target molecule is rare in biological systems.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Ligand binding to a receptor (receptor protein) alters its chemical conformation (three dimensional
 * shape). The conformational state of a receptor protein determines its functional state. Ligands
 * include substrates, inhibitors, activators, and neurotransmitters. The tendency or strength of
 * binding is called affinity. Binding affinity is determined not only by direct interactions, but
 * also by solvent effects that can play a dominant indirect role in driving non-covalent binding in
 * solution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The interaction of most ligands with their binding sites can be characterized in terms of a binding
 * affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand binding results from greater intermolecular force between
 * the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less intermolecular force
 * between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding involves a longer residence
 * time for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding.
 * High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the
 * binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered
 * behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A ligand that can bind to a receptor, alter the function of the receptor and trigger a
 * physiological response is called an agonist for that receptor. Agonist binding to a receptor
 * can be characterized both in terms of how much physiological response can be triggered and in
 * terms of the concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the physiological response.
 * High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate
 * to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a physiological response. Low-affinity
 * binding implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding
 * site is maximally occupied and the maximum physiological response to the ligand is achieved. If two
 * different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site.
 * Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined
 * as a "full agonist". An agonist that can only partially activate the physiological response is
 * called a "partial agonist". Ligands that bind to a receptor but fail to activate the physiological
 * response are receptor "antagonists".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Binding affinity data alone does not determine the overall potency of a drug. Potency is a result
 * of the complex interplay of both the binding affinity and the ligand efficacy. Ligand efficacy refers
 * to the ability of the ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor
 * and the quantitative magnitude of this response. This response may be as an agonist, antagonist, or
 * inverse agonist, depending on the physiological response produced.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Selective ligands have a tendency to bind to a very limited types of receptors, whereas non-selective
 * ligands bind to several types of receptors. This plays an important role in pharmacology, where drugs
 * that are non-selective tend to have more adverse effects, because they bind to several other receptors
 * in addition to the one generating the desired effect.
