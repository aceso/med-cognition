Copy the html and the image in this directory to the webserver docroot
and open it in browser. It shows an example of how to convert an
image into canvas, and then back into image. 

The purpose is to show that we can save reports as images, which can
be downloaded or uploaded to the cloud.

However, more work needs to be done on this sample. We need to be able
to select the region of the canvas that we want to convert to an image,
and not all the region. We also want to use a javascript drawing of
a graph as an input rather than an image.
