Drug analysis

input analysis
  drugname, types of cancers, stage of cancer, gene expressions, gene, 
  interacting compounds, protein, enzyme, pathway, species


which proteins directly interact with this drug
which proteins indirectly interact with this drug
drug epiproteomic interactions, direct and indirect
drug epigenetic interactions, direct and indirect
which proteins are required for this drug to be effective
which proteins will prevent this drug from being effective
which genes intracting with this drug
identify pathways leading into drug and out of the drug that are most connected
identify pathway components with the distribution of literature citations
compute biological distance between drugs and other entities
identify disease interaction with this drug
