The Plasma Lipid Bilayer

Cell Signaling Pathways - MAPK Pathway

MAP Kinase is MAPK - famous pathway

RAS, SOS, RAF, MEK, KSR, ERK

Tyrosine Kinase Receptors

PI3K - Kinase Pathway

Apoptosis Pathways

- Intrinsic signal of DNA damage/oxidative stress
- Extracellular signal through TNF receptor

These are independent. Development of novel molecules to promote
both above approaches.

Epigenetics and Chromatin Structure

DNA is coiled in Chromatin and it is regulated in signals from
the environment. The expression of genes gives rise to the phenotype.
PTM can lead to the reorganization of the structure.
Methylation of Histone H3
Acetylation of Histone H4
Phosphorylation of Histone H2B

Euchromatin regulation

RNA Polymerase

Heterochromatin regulation

Transcription Factors
These are proteins that bind to the DNA directly and regulate the
expression of genes.

DNA sequence is translated to a mRNA molecule which gives rise to
a protein.
