10^14 cells in our body
200-400 cell types
All life is made of cells
They come in thousands of shapes and sizes
Human body has 100 trillion of them
10000 can fit on the head of a pin
500 quadrillion chemical reactions in a cell in a day

Stem cells and cell differentiation
Pluripotency
CDX2 and OCT 3/4
CDX2 is downregulated, and OCT3/4 remains expressed
After 10 rounds of division, embryo becomes a blastocyst
Stem cells can divide and make copies of themselves indefinitely
For example hematopoeitic stem cells in red blood cells
Embryonic stem cells

CEllular phenotypes: Division, Differentiation, Crawling, Apoptosis

Macrophage chasing bacteria
