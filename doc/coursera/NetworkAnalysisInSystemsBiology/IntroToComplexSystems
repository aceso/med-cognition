Complex Systems

What is an agent?

Is an entity in a complex system.

Actuators
Sensors
Defence System
Energy Consumption

Agents have a boundary.
Natural agents have ability to self reproduce.
Have clock or circadian rhythm
Central Processing Unit
Unit Self repair
Transportation System

Natural Biological Complex Systems appear at various levels

Subcellular (nucleus, mitochondria)
Cellular (human cells, bacteria)
Tissues and cell pop
Multicellular organisms
Ecosystems, social structures (pond, rainforest, beehive).


Technology extends human fitness
Motorcycles increase motility
Improved Sensors
Cloths improve protection

Natural Evolution v/s Man made Evolution
Differences
- billions of years v/s thousands of years
slow v/s fast
limited to mutations that pass through generations v/s ideas
can become a product overnight

Similarities
Rate of evolution is different across the planet for both nature and 
technology
there is diffusion of evolution that reach every inch 

Open v/s Closed Complex Systems

Closed systems have defined boundaries, a CPY, a clock
sensors, and actuators, motility apparatus, they born live and die
they only grow to defined size self repair and preproduce

Open syustems have less defined boundaries, not clear governance
many agents of same  type acting stochastically but leading to
global emergent behaviors
Open systems grow faster, as they become more complex and diverse.
On the other hand, closed systems become less flexible as they grow

Ant colony is open system, but ant is closed system

Examples of Open and Closed Complex Systems, man-made and natural

A human cell
a human
a cow
weather system
stock maket

Human Cell as an Agent in a complex system or as a complex system itself

Viewing a human cell as an agent can be helpful in identifying its
functional components

actuators - crawling
sensors - membrane receptors, nuclear receptors
CPU - cell signalling network
unit self repair - authopaghy
defense system - interferon
boundaries - plasma membrane
energy consumption - ATP -> ADP, GTP->GDP, NADH->NAD
clock - circadian rhythms
self reproduction - cell cycle
transportation systems - retrograde transport
