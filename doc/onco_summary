Colorectal cancer (CRC)
wnt pathway applies to colorectal cancer. 24 gene based mutations are identified.
Genes included are: SOX9


Liver cancer/Hep B & C
RNA: miR-122 is a tumor-suppressor in liver cancer.
The absence of a tiny, abundant liver-specific microRNA (miRNA) molecule 
may lead to liver cancer, 
Models: mice

How are microRNAs created?
Some genes do not produce proteins, instead they make hundreds of very small RNA molecules comprizing around two dozen nucleotides, called microRNAs or miRNAs for short. Each of these tiny molecules is thought to interact with hundreds of other genes, for instance swithching them on and off, in a complex pattern of genome regulation in humans, and other complex organisms.

Cancer & kidney transplant patients
Grapefruit juice per day achieve the same benefits from an anti-cancer drug.
Its benefits is three times as much as the anti-cancer drugs such as 
Sirolimus & Ketoconazole

Drugs for kidney transplant: Sirolimus 
Sirolimus is used in combination with other medications to prevent rejection of kidney transplants. Sirolimus is in a class of medications called immunosuppressants. It works by suppressing the body's immune system. 

Fungal infections: Ketoconazole
Ketoconazole is most often used to treat fungal infections that can spread to different parts of the body through the bloodstream such as yeast infections of the mouth, skin, urinary tract, and blood, and certain fungal infections that begin on the skin or in the lungs and can spread through the body. Ketoconazole is also used to treat fungal infections of the skin or nails that cannot be treated with other medications. Ketoconazole is in a class of antifungals called imidazoles. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.
