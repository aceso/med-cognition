File Format FAQ
October 2001

This document addresses some questions about the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format that have been frequently posed by depositors and users over the past year. The information in this document has been gathered from the PDB Contents Guide document originally created at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a careful study of existing files, an RCSB Workshop held in October 1998, and discussion with many users of the data. The guidelines presented here are those used by the annotation staff at the RCSB-PDB.

This will be an evolving document. Questions, comments or suggestions about this document should be sent to deposit@deposit.rcsb.org.
SEQUENCE, COORDINATE, AND SEQUENCE DATABASE ISSUES

Q: What sequence is reported in PDB SEQRES records?

A: All residues in the crystal or in solution, including residues not present in the model (i.e., disordered, lacking electron density, cloning artifacts, HIS tags) are included in the SEQRES records.

Q: How are sequence differences between coordinate and SEQRES records handled (i.e., residues modeled as ALA, mutations, unknown residues)?

A: The residue names in the coordinate section should match the residue names in the SEQRES records, even if this involves having missing atoms. Residues modeled as ALA due to lack of side chain density are relabeled to match the SEQRES. The missing side chain atoms are listed in REMARK 470 of the PDB file.

Example:

SEQRES: MET GLU ASN SER ALA GLU PRO GLU GLN SER LEU VAL CYS GLN 
COORDS: MET GLU ASN SER ALA GLU PRO GLU GLN SER LEU ala CYS GLN 
                                                    ^^^         

In the example above, residue VAL in the SEQRES is modeled as ALA in the coordinates. The residue name in the coordinates is changed from ALA to VAL to remove the conflict as shown below.

SEQRES: MET GLU ASN SER ALA GLU PRO GLU GLN SER LEU VAL CYS GLN 
COORDS: MET GLU ASN SER ALA GLU PRO GLU GLN SER LEU VAL CYS GLN 
                                                    ^^^         

If there is a mutation from a natural sequence, the sequence including the mutation appears in the SEQRES records. It is irrelevant here what the wildtype sequence is. In the previous example, if the residue ALA was a point mutation, the sequence in the SEQRES records and the coordinates must match and are both labeled ALA.

If the identity of a residue is truly unknown, it is labeled UNK in both the coordinates and the SEQRES.

Q. What do the DBREF and SEQADV records represent?

A. The DBREF provides a cross-reference between the sequence listed in the SEQRES record and an entry in a sequence database (e.g., GenBank, or SWISS-PROT).

The SEQADV record identifies conflicts between sequence information given in the SEQRES and the sequence database entry given in the DBREF (for example, an engineered mutation). Residues missing in the coordinates are listed in remark 465, and are not listed in the SEQADV record.

Q. How is polymorphism/microheterogeneity described?

A.	It is well recognized that this is not well represented by PDB format. The current practice is described here.

Although microheterogeneity does not present a problem within the coordinate records, it does introduce a difficulty in the specification of the sequence in the SEQRES records where only a single residue may be specified for each sequence position.

In cases where a single sequence position is modeled as different residues and these residues differ with respect to occupancy, then the residue with the higher occupancy is used to the define the SEQRES sequence.

If the different residue models cannot be distinguished by occupancy, then the SEQRES sequence is defined using the residue which matches the sequence obtained from the sequence database reference.

For example, residue 60 has two isoforms (SER and VAL) modeled with equal occupancies; however, residue SER matches the sequence database reference. Residue SER is listed in the SEQRES, since it matches the sequence database reference. Residue SER is listed in the coordinates as residue 60, conformation A. Residue VAL is listed next also as residue 60, conformation B.

REMARK 999 is also added to the entry to explain the presence of the isoforms. The combined occupancies of the two isoforms should be less than or equal to 1.00; however, the interpretation of occupancies can be more complicated if each of the isoforms is individually disordered (as in PDB 1EJG).
LIGANDS AND MODIFIED RESIDUES

Q. How are three-letter residue names and chain identifiers for residue modifications and ligands assigned?

A.	There are four common cases: covalently bound ligands, protein residue modifications, nucleotide modifications, metal coordination interactions (for example the interaction between iron and histidine in hemoglobin), and non-covalently bound ligands.

Covalently bound ligands:

A traditional distinction has been made between covalently bound ligands and small residue modifications. A bound ligand is defined as a modification with greater than 10 atoms including hydrogens.

Covalently bound ligands are assigned the chain identifier of the polymer chain to which the ligand is bound. The bonding between the ligand and the residue is specified in PDB LINK records. The ligand coordinates appear as HETATM records following either the TER record for the bound chain or after the TER record for the last polymer chain. The ligand is assigned a unique residue number within chain to which it is bound. The residue that binds the ligand retains its standard name in both coordinate and SEQRES records. Additional PDB records MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONECT are provided to describe the ligand.

Protein residue modifications:

The residue including the modification is assigned a unique 3-letter code. This code is used to identify the modified residue in both the coordinate and SEQRES records. The coordinate records of the modified residue are labeled as HETATM records. These records are inserted in the correct sequence position in the atom list for the polymer chain in which the modification resides. Additional PDB records MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONECT are provided to define the modification.

A distinction has been made between small residue modifications and covalently bound ligands. A residue modification is defined as a modification of 10 or less atoms including hydrogens.

Noteworthy exceptions to the above treatment of modified residues are the cases of acetylation of the N-terminus (residue ACE) and amidation of the C-terminus (residue NH2). Although these cases could be treated as residue modifications which would be assigned new 3-letter codes, these modifications have traditionally been treated as independent residues which appear in both the coordinates and SEQRES records.

Nucleotide modifications:

DNA and RNA

Modified DNA nucleotide names are prefixed with a "+" character. The coordinate records for the modified nucleotide are identified as HETATM records. The coordinate records for the modified portion of the nucleotide are inserted at the end of the DNA polymer chain after the TER record. These coordinates carry the residue number and chain id of the nucleotide they modify; however, they carry residue name corresponding to the particular modification (e.g. a methyl modification may be identified by the name CH3). The one-letter code is preceded by "+" character in SEQRES record. Additional PDB records MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONECT are provided to define the modification.

tRNA

Nucleotide modifications in tRNA are handled in a manner analogous the protein residue modifications. Nucleotides in tRNA structures are specified using 3-letter codes.

Metal coordination:

Ligands interacting with a single chain of a macromolecule through metal coordination are assigned the chain identifier of the residue in the polymer chain to which the ligand is bound. Ligands interacting through metal coordination are assigned a unique residue number within the chain to which they bind.

Non-covalently bound ligands:

Ligands which are not covalently bound or metals which coordinate with multiple chains are not assigned PDB chain identifiers. Non-covalently bound polymer-like ligands which are composed of discrete units broken down in a chemically sensible manner, may be left as a grouping of multiple three-letter codes. The connections within the ligand are provided in LINK records.

Ligands covalently binding multiple polymer chains:

In the case of a ligand binding multiple chains through covalent bonds to each, the connecting group (regardless of size) is assigned a its own three letter code, but no chain ID. Polymer residues which bind the connecting ligand retain their standard names and these will appear in both coordinate and SEQRES records. MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONECT records are provided to further define the modification.

Some Examples:

Example - Covalently bound ligand from PDB 1D2F:

In this example Vitamin B6 complex, three-letter code PLP, is covalently bound to LYS A NZ. Since the complex has more than 10 atoms, it retains its original three letter code, as does the LYS to which it is bound. MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONECT records define the modification. The coordinates for the inhibitor appear in HETATM records following the TER card for that chain. The complex is given a unique residue number 400, but the same chain ID as the residue to which it is bound.

Example - Residue modification from PDB 1CLV:

In this example, a glutamine residue is modified to make pyroglutamate (5HP). Since this modification has fewer than 10 atoms, the entire residue including the modification is renamed with a new three-letter code. This code appears in the SEQRES records. The modification carries the same chain ID and residue number as the glutamine which it is modifying. The coordinate records for the entire residue and modification are inserted in the correct sequence position in the atom list for the polymer chain in which the modification resides.

Q. How are coordinated solvent molecules distinguished from the other solvent molecules in the coordinate list, for example (Mg+6H2O)?

A.	A magnesium ion coordinated with waters is treated differently from a non-coordinated magnesium ion. For example, the residue name for a magnesium ion coordinated with six waters is MO6. These waters are not further included in the list of solvent coordinates.

Example: From PDB 1D57:

In this example, the metal hydrate ligand interacts with two strands of DNA (chains A and B) and it is not assigned a chain ID.

Q. What are the minimum requirements for polymers in PDB entries?

A. Polypeptide systems with a chain length of 3 or greater are treated as polymers in PDB entries. Smaller systems are treated as independent ligands if they contain more than 10 atoms or as modifications if they have fewer than 10 atoms. Polynucleotide or polysaccharide systems with chain lengths of 2 or greater are treated as polymers.

Each polymer chain is assigned a unique identifier (chain ID). For proteins and nucleic acids, SEQRES records for each chain are provided. Polysaccharides are not assigned SEQRES records or TER records.

Covalently bound polymeric ligands are assigned chain IDs. Connections between polymeric groups are identified in LINK records.

Example: Non-covalently bound polymeric ligands from PDB 1A1M:

In this example, a MHC class I molecule is complexed (not covalently bound) with a peptide from the gag protein of HIV2. Since the peptide has more than 3 amino acids it is assigned its own chain ID (chain C) as well as SEQRES records.

Q. How are glycoproteins described?

A.	Covalently bound sugars are to be handled as HET groups with LINK records to define the points of attachment. Individual sugars will have individual residue numbers. A polysaccharide with a chain length of 2 or greater is treated as a polymer, otherwise it is treated as a ligand or a modification. For covalently bound polysaccharide polymers, the entire attached polysaccharide will have a unique chain ID but will have no SEQRES records. The residue(s) to which the polysaccharide is attached are assigned standard residue names. The modification is further described in MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL and CONNECT records.

Example: Covalently bound polymeric sugar from PDB 1EBV:

In this example the protein is glycosylated at ASN 144. Since this polysaccharide in this example has two or more sugars, it is considered a polymer chain. The ASN retains its original name and the modification is described with MODRES/HET/HETNAM/FORMUL/CONNECT records. The point of attachment is defined in LINK records. The attached sugar chain is assigned its own residue numbers and chain ID B, but is not assigned SEQRES records. The individual NAG groups retain their original names.

Q. What is done if only a portion of a bound ligand is included in the coordinates because of crystallographic disorder?

A.	If the chemistry of the ligand is known, the ligand is treated normally even if there are missing atoms.

ISSUES RELATED TO MULTIPLE POLYMER CHAINS

Q. How are chimeras described?

A.

Example from 1TOL: A chimera can be described as a single chain with a continuous sequence. Residue numbering proceeds throughout the entire chimera.

Example from 1TOL:

In this example the fusion protein comprises residues 1-86 of mature minor coat protein from gene III, including glycine-rich linker (GGGSEGGGSEGGGSEGGG), residues 295-421 of protein-TOLA, and the C-terminal tail with sequence (AAAHHHHHH).

Alternatively, chimeras can be described as multiple molecules, each assigned a different chain ID. For example, a chimeric molecule consisting of sequences from two different sources with a synthetic sequence linking the two biological sequences could be described as three molecules, each with its own chain ID (for example, A, B, and C). The residue numbering could start with 1 for each chain. LINK records would be listed to link the three chains.

Q. How are TER records used?

A. TER cards are used to unambiguously mark the ends of polymer chains, except for polysaccharides.

NMR ISSUES

Q. How are models in NMR ensembles organized in PDB entries?

A.	In older NMR files the atom serial numbers were consecutive across all models in the entry. Owing to limitations in the field width for the atom serial number, this practice resulted in some ensembles being divided among multiple PDB entries.

With entries processed since February 1999, the atom serial number is reset to 1 at the beginning of each model thereby allowing the full ensemble to be included within a single PDB entry.
